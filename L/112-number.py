number_of_tries = 3 #integer
multiplier = 1.5 #float
#int or integer is used for whole numbers.(my note)
#print(type(number_of_tries))
#flaot is used for numbers with decimals.(my note)
#print(number_of_tries + multiplier)# we get a float
#print(number_of_tries * multiplier) # we get a float
print(number_of_tries / multiplier)# even tho the answer is 2 it still responds as a float 2.0
