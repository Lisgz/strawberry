#add print statement for full name
#Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but not symbols. They cannot contain space.
print(last_name + ", " + first_name)
# "_" '_' both work in python. Can't use curly quotes.
#print('jason's turn') will cause an error message cuz python thinks we have an opening quote with no closing quote. change single quote to double and it will run.
