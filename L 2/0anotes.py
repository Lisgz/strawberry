#operators are assessed from right to left
#Logical operators involve using the keywords and, or, and not to compare two or more conditions
#slicing - the extracting of values from a list
#In programming a period mark is used to access an object o use one of its methods
# floor division(returns just the integer portion of an answer)
# modulus (shows the remainder after a division between two numbers)
# double ** indicates an exponent or as some refer to the power of
#multipication comes before addition in order of operation 
#% is the modulus symbol
#not takes precedence over or



#A (str) is a container that stores a value, such as a string of text, a number, or other data types
#Numbers represented as (int) can not be used in calculations 
#Python returns (float) when using an integer and a float in division
#A (converions) is a specific type of function that belongs to an instance of a class or an object and can access or modify the instance or object to which it belongs
#the (Conversion) function converts a value to a sting
#the start and end characters in a slice are separated with a (slicing)
#Data structures are types of list stored inside of (structures)
#(Lists) separate values within the list
#In the order of opterator percedence comparison comes before logical, which comes before assignment
#The (containment) operator determines whether a value is contained witin a list of values
#A assignment is a value attached to a variable, usually wiht an equal sign
#Assignment division returns an integer for result wihtout a remainder
#python and other languages use a double (comparison) sign as a comparison
#logical operators involve using the keywords and, (logical), and not to compare two or more conditions and then return a true or false
#The percent symbol is the (Arithmetic) operator, which shows the remainder after a division between two numbers
#Containment is important when one needs to know, for example, if an answer someone entered for a question is in an acceptable conaintment of answers
