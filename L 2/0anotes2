break ends a loop 
break - used to exit a loop of code
continues skips an iteration of a loop
 
when using a loop the first thing to determined if the loop should run a set number of time, or should the loop run until a condition is true or false

commas work better with data of different types like two strings with an integer in between (ex: "you have", score "points")

there are two aspects of conditional loops to be careful about. First ensure you have the correct comparison operator when setting a condition. ensure loop stops running at some point

for loop is designed to iterate over a squence, collection or data structure such as a list tuple or string runs for a set number of times based on the length of the condition

while loop runs as long as the certain condition is true

assertInstance - an assert test that determines whether a variable is an instance of a class

asserttrue - an assert test that determines whether a statement is true

Call signature - a line of code that calls a function and when applicable provides needed
